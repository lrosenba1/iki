Iki is a small programming language, which is why it is not named Nui.
It is small enough that one can write a complete, formal semantics for
the language, and that students can build a compiler themselves.

This project is an implementation of an Iki compiler written in Java.
It's a traditional Maven-based project.  It uses JavaCC for the front-end,
JUnit for testing, can output either JavaScript, C, or assembly language
for the x86-64 architecture.

If you are teaching a compiler course, feel free to have your students
fork this project and implement extensions to the language.
